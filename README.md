# ANN-on-Customer-Churn
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are instrumental in churn prediction, a critical task in industries like telecommunications and subscription services. ANNs excel in learning complex patterns from historical data to forecast customer churn.

In churn prediction, ANNs are typically trained on datasets containing customer demographics, usage patterns, and behaviors. The architecture of ANNs for churn prediction often includes multiple hidden layers with activation functions like ReLU to capture non-linear relationships between input features.

During training, ANNs adjust weights and biases using algorithms like stochastic gradient descent to minimize prediction errors. They learn to predict the probability of customer churn based on features such as contract type, customer tenure, service usage, and interaction history.

Successful deployment of ANNs in churn prediction hinges on data quality, feature selection, and model tuning to achieve optimal performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. ANNs enable businesses to preemptively identify customers at risk of churn, allowing for targeted retention strategies and improved customer retention rates.
